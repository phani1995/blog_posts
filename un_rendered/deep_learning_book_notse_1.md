* the performance of these machine learning algorithms depends heavily on the representation of the data of the data given.

* Representation Learning 

* when designing features or algorithms for learning features, our goal is usually to separate the factors of variation that explain the observed data. for example when analyzing an image of a car, the factors of variation include the position of the car, its color, the angle and brightness of the sun.
