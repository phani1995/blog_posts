* physics equations f = m*a using gradient decent to demon

* simple project in Django

* video for linear regression gradient decent implementation

* **t-SNE** visualization

* **loss functions** in keras

* Live minist prediction in using tensorflow js

* how does a neural network remember a digit using auto encoders

* difference between activation functions using the same network

* cifar 10 linear classification like cs231n

* disque comments for blog post

* ~~difference between latex and tex~~

* equations in matjax

* icons in contact of blog

* I can list down the companies for the sponsoring of conferences and search jobs according to those companies

* visual question answering dataset

* cloudCV applications

* mapilllary dataset training 

* mirror image using neural networks

* how to use tensorborad

* *Residual network*

* white paper on object tracking
