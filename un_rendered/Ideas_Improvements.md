# Ideas

* physics equations f = m*a using gradient decent to demon

* simple project in Django

* **t-SNE** visualization

* **loss functions** in keras

* Live minist prediction in using tensorflow js

* how does a neural network remember a digit using auto encoders

* difference between activation functions using the same network

* cifar 10 linear classification like cs231n

* disque comments for blog post

* ~~difference between latex and tex~~

* ~~equations in matjax~~ - you write in latex and matjax is a library which is used to convert latex to equations on webpage.

* icons in contact of blog

* I can list down the companies for the sponsoring of conferences and search jobs according to those companies

* visual question answering dataset

* cloudCV applications

* mapilllary dataset training 

* mirror image using neural networks

* how to use tensorborad

* *Residual network*

# Improvements

* ~~Need to read regularization in machine learning crash course~~

* Fork and star buttons of github
<a href="https://github.com/afshinea/keras-data-generator/fork"><button name="button">Click me</button></a>

* ~~Need Template photos in every post of site and medium~~
    * ~~Templates created for every post need to create in canva~~

* Tags in jekyll blog

* canvas tag for all types of algorithms, datasets, regression , classification according to the tree.
