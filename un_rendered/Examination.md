# Understanding JAVA Fundamentals(15-20%)
Describe the use of main in a Java application
 * Signature of main, why it is static; how to consume an instance of your own class; command-line arguments
Perform basic input and output using standard packages
 * Print statements; import and use the Scanner class
Evaluate the scope of a variable
* Declare a variable within a block, class, or method

# Working with datatypes,variables and expressions(40-45%)
Declare and use primitive data type variables
 * Data types, including byte, char, int, double, short, long, float, boolean; identify when precision is lost; initialization; how primitives differ from wrapper object types such as Integer and Boolean
Construct and evaluate code that manipulates strings
 * String class and string literals, comparisons, concatenation, case and length; String.format methods; string operators; converting a primitive data type to a string; the immutable nature of strings; initialization; null
Construct and evaluate code that creates, iterates, and manipulates arrays and array lists
 * One- and two-dimensional arrays, including initialization, null, size, iterating elements, accessing elements; array lists, including adding and removing elements, traversing the list
Construct and evaluate code that performs parsing, casting and conversion
 * Implementing code that casts between primitive data types, converts primitive types to equivalent object types, or parses strings to numbers
Construct and evaluate arithmetic expressions
 * Arithmetic operators, assignment, compound assignment operators, operator precedence

# Implement Control flow (15-20%)
Construct and evaluate code that uses branching statements
 * if, else, else if, switch; single-line versus block; nesting; logical and relational operators
Construct and evaluate code that uses loops
 * while, for, for each, do while; break and continue; nesting; logical, relational, and unary operators


# Perform object- oriented programming(10-15%)

Construct and evaluate a class definition
 * Constructors; constructor overloading; one class per .java file; this keyword; inheritance and overriding at a basic level
Declare, implement, and access data members in a class
 * private, public, protected; instance data members; static data members; using static final to create constants; describe encapsulation
Declare, implement, and access methods
 * private, public, protected; method parameters; return type; void; return value; instance methods; static methods; overloading
Instantiate and use a class object in a program
 * Instantiation; initialization; null; accessing and modifying data members; accessing methods; accessing and modifying static members; importing packages and classes

# Compile and debug code(5-10%)
Troubleshoot syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors
 * print statement debugging; output from the javac command; analysing code for logic errors; console exceptions after running the program; evaluating a stack trace
Implement exception handling
 * try catch finally; exception class; exception class types; display exception information
