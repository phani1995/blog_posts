# Research in Deep Learning

Deep learning is exploding field of artificial intelligence. There is a lot going on in this field as of now. High quality research being done as we speak . Investor turning their heads towards the investing in  machine learning. Tech giants like google amazon coming up with AI giants home products. so deep learning have a lot do in our lives in future.

How to get to started with research in deep learning......?

Well to know about the research first we need to know about the research community and how typically academic research functions  ....

When we think of research we think of going to internet and typing the keywords in google reading the first five links and getting an a inference about the topic we spoke about. Does this work for academic research ..? may be not . When it come to intenser academic research there we need a 
``the systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions``, sounds confusing well, that's academic research it requires you to read the things with twice packing so much knowledge into few sentences.

Where is the knowledge acquired by one is shared with other people in the community ......``Conferences``
